# Fummins 101
So you have decided that you want a Cummins in your Ford, but you have no idea where to even start? This page is for you. What all do you need? How much is it going to cost? How long will it take? Will you need a lift? These questions are common, and get asked by almost everyone their first time, so don't feel afraid to ask stupid questions. Most of them aren't stupid at least :)

## What all will you need
This is a really open ended question, because it depends a lot of what you already have. Is your truck a manual or an automatic? Is it already a diesel, or a gasser? What year is it? But regardless of all of these, there are a few things you will need no matter what.

1. Engine Mounts
2. Transmission Adapter
3. Radiator hoses
4. CAC Pipes
5. Exahust Manifold
6. Downpipe
7. Air Filter and intake piping

Different engines and truck years have different options for all of these. This list will not get you working cruise control or A/C. It probably won't cool very well with the stock cummins fan and whatever radiator your truck has. But it should at least get the truck moving under its own power in most cases.

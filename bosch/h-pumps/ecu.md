# Bosch H-Pump ECU Info
There isn't a lot of options out there for ECU's for H-Pumps outside of the OEM applications.

## [Baldur's DSL1](https://controls.is/shop/dsl1)
A diesel engine controller for engines equipped with a Bosch M-type EDC electronic diesel injection pump, such as Mercedes Benz OM605 and OM606, as well as VP37 injection pumps found on lots of different cars.

### Downsides
1. ECU not IP67 rated, must run wires into the cab
2. No J1939 support by default
3. No schematic avaiable, your right to repair doesn't exist

## Custom
[Joshua Austill](jlaustill@gmail.com) has decided to give it a try at making a custom ECU for H Pumps that will bolt right in place of a 24v ECU.
